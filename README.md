The Workshop's roadmap:

1) Basic theories behind Genome Wide-Association Study (GWAS)
2) What we need to conduct Genome Wide-Association Study (GWAS)
3) Hands-on tutorial session to demonstrate Genome Wide-Association Study (GWAS)

The subjects about step 1 and step 2 need the file "Presentation - GWAS - Guilherme Oliveira".

The subjetcs about step 3 need the files: "PhenotypicData", "GenotypicData", "GenotypicMap" and "GWASscript".

1) The files: "Presentation - GWAS - Guilherme Oliveira" and "PhenotypicData" were made and collected by Guilherme Oliveira.
2) The files: "GenotypicData" and "GenotypicMap" were made and collected by Cristiano Mathias Zimmer.
3) The file: "GWAS Script" was made by Guilherme Oliveira based on the Script of Julio Isidro-Sanchez (Chapter 14: Genome Wide-Association Analysis using R - Oat Mehotds and Protocols).
